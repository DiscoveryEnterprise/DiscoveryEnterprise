   <div id="main"><span id="content"><h1>Atlantis-Short story of Demise</h1>
     <cite>"Beyond being only a human, he had one defect, he valued his people and his world more than he valued himself and his life.
        A defect that brought his demise, a death more than worthy of history books."</cite><br><br>
     |As the people rushed onto his land, he turned to his son and said:|<br><br>
     Discovery: My son, I now have to go, and sadly, this time I won`t be coming home. I chose my way, my road years ago. Now it is your time to choose yours. See, in life, the roads of the loved ones may divide, the time will come when you`ll have to follow your own path, as I did years ago when I was younger. Live your life happily, and pursue your dreams no matter the odds, do what you love, but do it with virtue. Don`t follow this path I`ve chosen, nor seek to avenge me, for I have sought to avenge the world and faced the darkness of this world alone. It would bring you nothing but hate and humiliation, damn if Tesla wasn`t right. For some, justice can never be done. So live that you won`t need to be avanged.<br><br>
     Son: But father, how could I or you forgive me If I stood by doing nothing as the world you, and everyone who came before us died protecting, collapsed? How could I sleep at night as your legacy is being torn apart by these forces of evil?<br><br>
     Discovery: You have a beautiful heart my son, and a strong will few humans have. I am proud of you, no matter the end. Till we`ll meet again!<br><br>
     |As he was taken by the people, he heard a voice talking to him, a voice that said:|<br><br>
     Rest your soul now, for your fight has just begun.<br><br>

     |As they took him in front of the firing squad, members of his former loyal to the death legions, he had one last wish, before facing the inevitable.|<br><br>
     Discovery: I, as your former leader, who gave everything for your well being and the freedom of your children, demand to give myself the firing order.<br><br>
     Comisar Divizion: At your order, « Your Highness », just like it would change anything.<br><br>
     Comisar Divizion: Division, at the signal of the convict, release batteries!<br><br>
     |As the rain started falling, Discovery took one last glimpse at the fading sun, thinking of what it could have been. Then, with such a strong heart, he raised his sword to the sky once more. The shots were fired, and his sword fell for the first time after a lifetime of battles.|<br><br>
     |“The light in his eyes started fading, his heart stopped beating and his body turned cold. This once indomitable will stood now as everyone else in their last hour. This soul who gave it all, stood  there, lifeless, on the battlefield. Inconceivable.|<br><br>
     |In the meantime, at the end of times, Discovery wakes up and sees the devastated Earth beneath him. Suddenly a voice starts speaking and he sees a strange figure gazing at his world.|<br><br>
     Voice: Interesting. Above all, this is what you miss the most, what you hold dearest to your heart. It is not common for a soul to build such things when he is about to rejoin his home.<br><br>
     |Discovery looks at his world, collapsing in front of him|<br><br>
     Discovery: So this is how it ends?This is how the Journey of the last Prime truly ends? With the thrival of evil? All those sacrifices, all the deaths and lost dreams, all for nothing in the end? This is how the Story of mankind ends, total annihilation?<br><br>

     Voice:You really have no Faith in your people?<br>
     They will fight for ages, but they will succed. They will survive, that's what humans do.<br><br>

     Discovery:They could have blossomed so well!<br><br>

     Voice:They were never meant to. See, Prime, they fight, and fight harder for their pathetic lives, not knowing what tomorrow may offer. That what makes their lives so special, so beautiful. Every moment of their short pointless lives is unique and it won`t happen again. Yet they keep on believing they have a meaning and find new things to lay violence on.
     It seems that the frailest of things can have the strongest of will.<br><br>

     Discovery: Eons of war, destruction and death. There must be a way to change it. There must be more behind this war. Humanity is more than Chaos, Humanity is equilibrium, just as everything else around them.<br><br>

     Voice: You still take their side, after everything you've seen? Not a single soul stood by your side, Discovery! You fought a war against yourself all this time. No human loved you, no human cared about your death and no human will remember any of your deeds. Don't act like you're one of them cause they were never one of you! They brought this fate upon themselves.<br><br>

     Voice: They will take the rest of their pittyful existance in the worst ways possible and they will never reach the skies ever again. For they have lost their place among the stars the moment they sentenced their World to death.<br><br>
     Voice: They sentenced their last hero, their last leader and warrior to death. There is no humanity left in these “humans”,  there will be no more starborns for their very hearts are now frozen and there is no one left to melt them anymore. For you were, indeed the last of the Primes. The last of the real humans.<br><br>
     Discovery: If so, I am far from being a Prime, for I have failed my purpose of  protecting the humans. I failed my world, and because of my lack of success, Earth will die too. There won`t be new generations to. And all this on my watch.<br><br>
     Voice: The last always meant the end, and everything is bound to fail. This time, mankind lost it`s fire.<br><br>
     Voice: And in the absence of their light, there will only be darkness from now on.  Their fate has been written and it is sealed forever.<br><br>

     Discovery: I am not supposed to be a master of fates, and neither should be no one. You cannot choose onto someone's existance. I won't sit and watch them burn, for you consider me worthy of this fate.<br><br>

     Discovery: I, Discovery Prime, choose to go back, and not by any of your means, I'll return myself.
     I choose to live my life!<br><br>

     Voice: You fool, You will die like the rest of mankind, you will live in misery for the rest of your days, and for what? You'll have no statues, no gratitude, no name.
     You will never be one of them! They will never welcome them as their brother, you will live the same sentence, in the same small world, alone.<br><br>

     Discovery: If there is any chance to change that, I must try. And if I'm bound to fail, I'll fail at a greater virtue than any of you! For now I am Master of my will.<br><br>
